            <h2>Why everyone is talking about Hardware</h2>
            <p>
                Currently a lot of people talk about investments in computer hardware. Nvidias stock is growing and Sam Altman talks about giant sums to invest into new chip factories. I am going to try to explain why this is happening and what it means for the future.
                Lets look at the demand first. AI is obviously one of the driving forces and most companies are trying to get their hands on the best hardware. The demand for AI is growing and the models are getting bigger and bigger. 
                To run these models you can use normal CPUs as they exist in every computer, but this is slow. The better way is to use GPUs. They are much faster and can run the models in parallel. This is why Nvidia is growing so fast. They are the biggest producer of GPUs and their software is the best for AI.
                Hardware is also a matter of national security. Many countries are trying to get access to more hardware. Not only because of the importance for the economy and future growth, but also because of the importance for the military. 
                But where is the problem? Why cant they just buy more chips from Nvidia? In some cases like China they are not allowed to buy certain chips from the US. But even if you are a company from the US, you might not get the chips you need.
                Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and many more are all trying to get their hands on more chips. They are also producing their own chips.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lets look one step deeper. None of the companies mentioned above are producing their own chips. The only exception is intel and they are not doing well. Most companies are using TSMC to produce their chips.
                The reason why none of them produce their own chips is that it is very expensive. To be able to invest that much into building chips you need to produce more chips than any of the companies mentioned above need.
                Thats why TSMC is for the most part the only company that produces chips. They are the biggest and most advanced chip producer in the world. So why are they not producing more chips?
                TSMC is already at their limit. To understand why they cannot produce more we need to understand how chips are produced.

                The technology to produce chips is called lithography. The core idea is to use light to print the patterns of the chip on a silicon wafer. The smaller the patterns, the more transistors you can fit on the chip. The more transistors, the more powerful the chip.
                As transistors got smaller and smaller, the light waves needed to get smaller to not blur the patterns. To create current chips the light waves have to be outside of the visible spectrum. This is called extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV).
                Creating pure EUV light and directing it through the lenses is very hard. The process involves high power lasers that create plasma out of tin drops. The plasma emits EUV light. The light is then directed through a series of incredibly precise lenses to print the patterns on the silicon wafer.
                The technology needed is at the edge of what humanity can create. To produce the machine that is able to to that you have to combine the experts of many top companies around the world. And all of this comes together in the netherlands at ASML. They are the only company that produces the machines that are able to produce the chips.
                Their first version of that was able to produce chips with EUV costed over 150 million dollars and they are only able to produce a few of them a year. All of them get shipped as soon as they are produced. The machines themself are only able to produce a limited amount of chips a day.
                They recently started shipping a new lithography machine that is able to produce these chips faster and more precise. But the demand is so high that they are not able to produce enough of them. They also now cost over 350 million dollars.

                Customers of TSMC are also worring about their location. TSMC is located in Taiwan and the ambiguent situation with China is a risk for the supply chain. The US is trying to get TSMC to produce more chips in the US. But this is not easy. Building factories and training workers to use the machines is a long process. 
                Taiwan is also not interested in lessening the dependence of other countries on them. Being the main source of high end chips makes Taiwan a central part of the global economy and forces other countries to protect them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So we have a need for more chips and the factories are not able to produce more, because ASML is not able to produce more machines and ASML is not able to produce more machines because they are dependent on one of the most complex supply chains in the world.
                So how are Sam Altman and others planning to solve this? There are a few options. Some TSMC customers starting to produce chips that are specialised for AI workflows. 
                This does not increase the total amount of chips, but it makes the chips that are produced more efficient at the task that is needed most right now. The alternatve is to build more factories. Countries like south korea and the US are investing into factories, but it is not clear if they will work and even 
                if they do, there is still the problem of ASML as the bottleneck. The only way to get more machines is to grow ASMLs entire supply chain or find a way to produce chips in another way. Canon or Nikon, both japanese companies, are also producing lithography machines, but they are not as advanced as ASMLs machines.
                Due to demand many companies will try to fill the gap and new ideas will emerge. Examples are quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, and photonic computing. But all of these are not ready yet and it is not clear if they will be able to fill the gap.
            </p>
            <p>
                The future of hardware is not clear. The only thing that is clear is that the demand is growing and the supply is not able to keep up. This will lead to a lot of investements and new ideas. The future of AI and many other technologies is dependent on the future of hardware.
                I hope I could give a good overview of the current situation and the problems that are ahead.
