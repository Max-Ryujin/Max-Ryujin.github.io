            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a computer science student at RWTH University in Germany with a passion for AI and the pursuit of AGI. I share insights and discussions here, hoping to spark open dialogues. </p>
            <p>Nearly 10 years ago I started reading about the singularity and shifted my focus from physics to computer science to work on machine learning. I programmed my first neural networks and finished school. After I started studying computer science 
                at RWTH Aachen University, I began to work on my own AI projects and research. I am currently working on my master's degree and researching AI. I spend most of my time following current developements in AI, Longevity, Neurobiology, Politics, Philosophie, Math, and Physics.</p>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Current Endeavors:</strong> Master's in Computer Science, AI research, Public Speaking.</p>
