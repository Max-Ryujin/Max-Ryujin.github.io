            This is a timeline of events in AI and other fields as I experienced them in my life. I started following the developements in singularity adjacent fields in 2015. I also added future predictions of mine. 
            I don't think it makes sense to continue the timeline after 2030, as the world will be so different that it is impossible to predict.
